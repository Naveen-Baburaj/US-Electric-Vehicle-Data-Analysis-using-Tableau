# USA Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

## Introduction

This project focuses on analysing electric vehicle data in the United States using Tableau. The goal is to provide insights into the adoption of Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicles (CAFV), including Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV), across different states.

## Appendix

### Glossary of Terms
- **CAFV**: Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle - a vehicle that runs on alternative fuels...
- **EV**: Electric Vehicle - a vehicle that is powered by electricity...
- **BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle)**: A type of electric vehicle that is powered entirely by electricity stored in onboard batteries. BEVs have no internal combustion engine and produce zero emissions during operation.
- **PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle)**: A hybrid vehicle that combines a conventional internal combustion engine with a battery that can be charged by plugging into an external source. PHEVs can run on electricity alone for a certain range before switching to gasoline or diesel.
